        <h2>Large-scale Nested Data Processing and Wikidata</h2>
        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">On the occasion of starting work in my new
                    position (distributed processing of nested data), I thought it worth writing a short post about the
                    challenges, my ideas regarding large-scale nested data processing, and Wikidata dump processing. We
                    also have a warm-up project using Spark!</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Wikidata is a collaborative and open KG,
                    well-known for its massive size and complicated structure. It now (March 2023) has more than 102
                    million items and nearly 1.4 billion facts about those items and these numbers growing like every
                    minute. Wikidata is called a Knowledge Graph, but it is not stored in native graph DBMSes, its
                    backend is a MySQL database and its original dumps are in JSON, but as a Linked Open Data dataset,
                    the dumps are published in RDF format as well.</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">The Wikidata JSON dump, with nearly 105 GB
                    of data (compressed), is the input of several tasks, including Subsetting. Almost all practical
                    subsetting tools (i.e., WDSub, WDumper, Wikibdase Dump Filter, and KGTK) get the JSON.gz dump. And
                    as a complex, unbalanced, and massive nested structure, the JSON dump is a tempting target for
                    large-scale nested data processing.</span></span></p>

        <h2><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">&nbsp;</span></span><span
                style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">What is Large-Scale Nested Data
                    processing?</span></span></h2>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Well, nested data are widely used nowadays.
                    Data transfer in web applications and from the front end to the back end is almost entirely based on
                    JSON. No-SQL and hierarchical databases and DBMSes are on the other side. There is a high demand for
                    processing nested data</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">On the other hand, these data are massive.
                    So, one of the first approaches that come to mind in such a situation is to distribute the
                    processing using distributed platforms like Hadoop and Spark.</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">But distributed processing on nested data on
                    a large scale has challenges [1]:</span></span></p>

        <h3><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Programming Mismatch</span></span></h3>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">It refers to the common problem of
                    transferring centralized computations on distributed platforms. So the main problem in such cases is
                    that the distributed algorithm needs to access some parts of data that are not available at the
                    current working node.</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">The traditional solutions are repeating the
                    parts of data that are most likely to be needed in all worker nodes, but such an approach will
                    increase redundancy and needs more storage space, so it is costly.</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Another solution is to Flatten the nested
                    data and to request to join the flattened data whenever it is not available. But flattening also
                    reduces the accuracy and it is possible some parts are missed in such joins requests, so there is a
                    chance of having errors.</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">A more recent solution from [1] is a
                    compilation framework, very similar to a query optimization approach: doing joint requests as
                    top-level as possible!</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">In the Wikidata dump, and for querying the
                    dump or subsetting the dump, it is quite possible that we face this challenge. The main reason is
                    the linked nature of the dump because top-level blobs (which are the items) are connected with
                    statements linked together, so it is quite possible that any query would need items that are not
                    available at the current worker node.</span></span></p>

        <h3><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Top-level vs. Low-level
                    Tuples</span></span></h3>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">This challenge is when the number of
                    top-level tuples is low but the number and the amount of data in their nested parts (low-level
                    tuples) are high. Because the distribution is based on top-level tuples, having a low number of them
                    will reduce the parallelization ratio, which reduces the efficiency.</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">The traditional solution for this problem is
                    to flatten the nested data, but again we will have the possibility of errors and lots of redundancy.
                    Another limitation is that we will lose the nested structure for the intermediate queries when the
                    output of a query is the input of another query, and we would need this intermediate output to be
                    nested as well.</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Smith et al.&#39;s [1] solution for this
                    problem is called Shredding Framework, which is an optimized flattening algorithm that creates
                    concise outputs. This shredding should be applied to both data and the query, and it&#39;s based on
                    mapping the inner nested parts to labels and using pointers to these labels.</span></span></p>

        <h3><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Skewed Data</span></span></h3>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">It refers to the imbalances in the amount of
                    data in the nested blobs which raises performance issues as some parts take longer processing time
                    than others.</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">This is a real problem in the context of
                    Wikidata JSON dumps. For example, while some items have 10 statements, some others have more than
                    200 statements. In the second level, where some statements have one reference, some have more than
                    20 references or more.</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">The only way to deal with this problem in
                    nested data is the Skew-resilient Processing framework [1], which has 3 steps:</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">1. Identify heavy nodes, i.e., finding those
                    blobs with more data than a specific threshold</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">2. Create the Skew Triple, which is
                    separating the heavy and light blobs</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">3. Apply separate processing plans for the
                    light and heavy blobs. For heavy blobs, there would be a second level of distribution.</span></span>
        </p>

        <h2><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Nested-data and Wikidata</span></span></h2>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">I have two ideas:</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">The first one is to study the Wikidata Dump
                    as a use case using available heuristics. There are very joint features like Wikidata dumps that are
                    JSON based, which are quite Massive in size. Its Query time is very important and a challenge.
                    Subsetting is important and is a current problem and the fact that it is very skewed and also
                    interconnected.</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">So in theory, I think the nested data
                    algorithms and heuristics can be applied to Wikidata distribution processing, but we need also some
                    modifications. For example, we need to transform the algorithms in the context of graphs. Queries
                    should be in the form of SPARQL.</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">The second suggestion is vice versa: using
                    graph representations for helping nested data processing, i.e., deploying graph triples to flatten
                    data. and subsequently, we need to create a mapping from initial queries to SPARQL. There are
                    several nested structures (like JSON) to RDF mapping approaches. In that case, we will have some
                    redundancy (maybe a lot), but we might get good performance because the RDF structure is very
                    simple.</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">One of the challenges in both directions is
                    that the Spark GraphX platform is not well maintained as far as I know. So we might need to think of
                    a different distribution approach.</span></span></p>

        <h2><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">A Warm-Up Spark Computation</span></span>
        </h2>

        <p>I tried to implement a very simple experiment: an average calculation distributed on three LAN machines using
            Spark. To do this, I used one of the large RQSS_Extractor output files from the Gene Wiki subset, which can
            be downloaded from <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7336208">zenodo.org/record/7336208</a> (Download
            GeneWiki_rqss_extractor_output.zip and use statement_node_ref_num.data)</p>

        <p>This file is ~5 GB in size and contains 63521697 records. I added a record as the header (<span
                style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">statementNode,score</span>) in the first line and
            changed the file extension to <span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">.csv</span>. The part
            we are dealing with is the second column (<span
                style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">score</span>). We want to get the average of this
            column.</p>

        <p>A simple non-distributed program to calculate the average like the below takes ~150 seconds on my machine:
        </p>

        <p><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">import pandas as pd<br />
                from datetime import datetime<br />
                start=datetime.now()<br />
                data =
                pd.read_csv(&quot;file:///scratch/spark-test/rqss_extractor_output/statement_node_ref_num.csv&quot;)<br />
                print(&quot;The average score is {:5f}&quot;.format(data[&#39;score&#39;].mean()))<br />
                end=datetime.now()<br />
                print(&#39;time: &#39;,(end-start).total_seconds())</span></p>

        <p>Then, I downloaded Spark standalone from this link:&nbsp;<a
                href="https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/spark/spark-3.3.2/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3.tgz">https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/spark/spark-3.3.2/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3.tgz</a>
        </p>

        <p>I decompressed the binaries, putting the binaries on four Linux machines connected as a LAN, calling them
            <strong>Linux01</strong>, <strong>Linux02</strong>, <strong>Linux03</strong>, and <strong>Linux04</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>Linux01 is the master, others will be the workers. So on Linux01, I ran the following command:</p>

        <p><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3/sbin/start-master.sh</span>
        </p>

        <p>and Linux01 will be my master node with URL:&nbsp;spark://linux01:7077. Then I ran the following on the other
            machines:</p>

        <p><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3/sbin/start-worker.sh
                spark://linux01:7077</span></p>

        <p>I also installed PySpark on Linux01.</p>

        <p>Now I wrote the following code using PySpark (thanks to the <a
                href="https://www.projectpro.io/recipes/perform-descriptive-statistics-on-columns-of-dataframe-pyspark">https://www.projectpro.io/recipes/perform-descriptive-statistics-on-columns-of-dataframe-pyspark</a>):
        </p>

        <p><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">import pyspark<br />
                from pyspark.sql import SparkSession<br />
                import pyspark.sql.functions as f<br />
                spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(&#39;score_average&#39;).getOrCreate()<br />
                df =
                spark.read.load(&quot;file:///scratch/spark-test/rqss_extractor_output/statement_node_ref_num.csv&quot;,
                format=&quot;csv&quot;, sep=&quot;,&quot;, inferSchema=&quot;true&quot;, header=&quot;true&quot;)<br />
                df.select(&quot;score&quot;).describe().show()</span><br />
            &nbsp;</p>

        <p>then used the following command to submit the program to my small Spark cluster:</p>

        <p><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">./spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3/bin/spark-submit --master
                spark://linux01:7077 --deploy-mode client score_average.py</span></p>

        <p>and this time, I have the average, along with max, mean, count and standard deviation in less than 35
            seconds!</p>
